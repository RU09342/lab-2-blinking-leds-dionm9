# Multiple Blink
The program works by first initializing the device, initializing LED 1, initializing LED 2, and initializes an integer "count" to 0. The progam works infinite loop. Each time the loop completes, a count variable is incremented. The program then checks if count is divisable by 2500 and 5000. If it is divisable by 2500, the program toggles LED 1, and if it is diviable by 5000, it toggles LED 2. If count is 5000, it then resets to 0. This loop does not stop under any condition (unless the user stops it or the processor breaks).
