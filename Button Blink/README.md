# Button Blink
This program works by first initializing the device, initializing LED 1, and Button 1. Once this is complete, the program goes into an infinite loop. This loop waits for the button to be pressed. Once the button is pressed, the program runs through a debounce program and if pressed, toggles the LED and sets press to 1. Setting press to 1 stops the program from going through the debounce program again without the button being release. Once the button is released, press is set to 0. After this, the program waits for a button press. This repeats until the program is stopped by the user. 
## Implimented Extra Work
One problem the program has when it runs is button bouncing. To compensate for this, a software debounce was created. The debounce works by initializing a count value to 25, then adding 1 to count if the button is pressed and subtracting 1 to count if the button is not pressed. This happens at every clock cycle. Once the count value reaches 50, it will return 1 indicating the button is pressed, or if count reaches 0, the function will return 0. The loop checks that debounce returns 1 and that it wasn't previously pressed. This stop the code from running after the first debounce.
