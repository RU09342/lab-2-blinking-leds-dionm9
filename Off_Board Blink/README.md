# Off Board Blink
The program is the same exact program found in the simple blink program. The function first stop the watch dog timer, initializes LED 1 out, then runs in an infinite loop. This loop delays 50000 cycles, then turns the led on, then waits 50000 leds and turns the led off. This then loops continuously.
